# AFL Wednesday Wonk

## A weekly data driven discussion about AFL

This is a weekly project that copies #makeovermonday style projects (and directly copied from the `r4ds` #tidytuesday concept) but aimed at AFL Analytics. There are no constraints as to the tools that can be used other than each week an interesting question or topic will be posted and members encouragec to attempt to answer it using data. 

***

Join the AFLWonk online learning community in the weekly #AFLWednesdayWonk event! Every week we will pose a new question or topic, sometimes with associated data. Your job is to attempt to answer that question using a data driven approach. There are no rules other than share your answer either within the `AFLWonk` [slack](slack.com) group, on [Twitter](twitter.com) or on your own blog. We will likely select some good answers to highlight each week. Work in pairs, groups or on your own. The goal is to get as many people talking about and trying to use these data approaches and hopefully learning off each other! 

There are no required tools to use. We want people of all skill levels to participate. Ideally if those of us who use some kind of programming language will post our code as well to help broaden the knowledge of the group. Many of us use `R` but any kind of data processing and visualisation tools can be used (yes, even Excel!). As long as it helps you to form an argument.

Anyone in the group is more then welcome to particupate - newcomers, veterans, programmers, excel nerds, footy writers, Twitter celebreties. Just ask that we keep some of these rules in mind (note - I've adapted these rules directly from the [r4ds tidytuesday page](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday))

1. This is NOT about criticizing the AFL media. While we all get frustrated with the AFL media, I don't want this to become a tear down of them. We may post some of their articles as a 'reworking' exercise but treat it as a tool for looking at it through a different lense.
2. This is NOT about criticizing or tearing down your fellow #AFLWonk members! Be supportive and kind to each other! Like other's posts and help promote the #AFLWonk community!
3. The source of any data set will be referenced so please be mindful to do the same if you are sharing your contributions.
4. Use the hashtag #AFLWonkWednesday on Twitter if you create your own version and would like to share it.
5. Include a picture of the visualisation when you post to Twitter.
6. Include a copy of the code used to create your visualization when you post to Twitter. Comment your code wherever possible to help yourself and others understand your process!
7. Focus on improving your craft, even if you end up with someting simple! Make something quick, but purposeful!
